    <h2>BACKGROUND:</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>I started working part time along with finishing school as a Graphic designer creating marketing materials such as websites, business cards, banners etc.
    When the need to get serious profession came I switched to Trade - industry at first at my hometown Industry Park - mostly production lines with shift systems. 
    I was switching through jobs looking for a decent opportunities and ended up coming to London to work in Automotive Accident Repairs. Stable, backed up by my previous work experiences and the one I feel confident in. I have been living in London for almost 8 years, in that time I worked for 2 Bodyshops. 
    At the end of November 2020 I have moved to Nottinghamshire and I'm currently working for largest automotive accident repair center in UK, all good so far. I have done my MET technician certification in april 2021.</p>
